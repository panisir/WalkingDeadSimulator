In the 23rd century the war between two empires led to a nuclear apocalypse which led to extinction of nearly all civilization and animal life. As we are the only survivors we are trying to build a new civilization but resources required to sustain life are rare. The radioactivity makes outdoors dangerous. We are living in an old bunker that is left from WW2. Volunteers need to get out to the dangerous lands and get to the places where they can get resources. Luckily the bunker we are living has an old radar that can find creatures on our path to the resources. As a surviving engineer you are required to write a simulation that can simulate if a volunteer can reach to resources. Be aware that our radar indicates that there are dangerous creatures and even zombies on the wasteland. Write a simulation that find outs if the hero would survive or not. You can use the following sample input and output as a reference. If the volunteer hero faces an enemy he needs to fight against it until one of them dies. To simulate fights you can accept that enemy and the hero attack at the same time. hp represents health points. Each attack decreases health points equal to attack. To avoid radioactivity volunteer hero wears a special heavy armor that makes him walk meter by meter.
